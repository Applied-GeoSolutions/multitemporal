This library provides an efficient means of flexibly performing time series
analysis on stacks of gridded data. There is a core python application that
breaks the processing job into pieces and launches workers to perform the
processing. Each worker has a configurable sequence of processing steps. All
the inputs and each step are prescribed in a user-conigured JSON files.

## Dev Setup

Build a container, set an alias to let you run tests using your host machine's
working copy, then run the test suite:

```
$ time docker build . -t mt --no-cache
$ alias rmt="docker run --rm -it -v ${HOME}/src/multitemporal/:/multitemporal"
$ time rmt mt python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
$ rmt mt pytest -vv -s
```
